In this folder, I wrangle/clean data for my first capstone project.

<p></p>

## Files: 

### 'default of credit card clients.csv'

'default of credit card clients.csv' contains the original data to be wrangled.

### 'Data_Wrangling.ipynb'

In this Jupyter Notebook, I check for missing values, mis-categorized values, and outliers.  Where necessary I make corrections to the data.  I export the corrected data to a new csv file called 'default of credit card clients - wrangled.csv'.

### 'data_cleaning-default_of_credit_card_clients.py'

This Python script will read the original data from 'default of credit card clients.csv', make the necessary corrections (as identified in the aforementioned Jupyter Notebook) to the data, and export the corrected data to 'default of credit card clients - wrangled.csv'.


### 'default of credit card clients - wrangled.csv'

'default of credit card clients - wrangled.csv' contains the wrangled/cleaned data.

# Data Wrangling Steps:

1. First, I verified that the data did not contain any null values;
2. Second, I categorized all variables as either discrete (categorical) or continuous variables;
3. Third, I analyzed the discrete (categorical) variables:



Submission: Create a short document (1-2 pages) in your github describing the data wrangling steps that you undertook to clean your capstone project data set. What kind of cleaning steps did you perform? How did you deal with missing values, if any? Were there outliers, and how did you decide to handle them? This document will eventually become part of your milestone report.

Submit a link to this document.
